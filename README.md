# Applied Data Science Capstone

## Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - Car accident severity


_Yatin Koul_  
 

Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, 
over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to 
leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a 
problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.


## 1) Introduction/Business Problem

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to 
solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of 
stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about 
your problem.

**_The idea of this project is to analyze the severity of an accident in the United States of America. The main objective of this capstone project is to engineer a predicting model using Machine Learning techniques in order to predict the accident severity in the US._** 

**_Problem Statement: What is the magnitude of severity for an accident that occurs in USA?_**

## 2) Downloading and Prepping Data

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use 
the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea.

**_This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset._**

**_The data is taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents_**

**_This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to June 2020 for the Contiguous United States._**


## 3) Methodology

Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis
that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.


## 4) Results

Results section where you discuss the results.


## 5) Discussion

Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.


## 6) Conclusion

Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
